Hello guys this is UCBDev,<br>
I will show you how to implement Serilog with its different kind of sinks like Console, File, Debug, PostgreSQL and Seq. We will configure them just from inside of the appsettings so we will get rid of extra code for it.
Also we will run Seq in our local machine and collect metrics from the Log context of our API. We can manage our logs, set alerts, visualize our logs, etc. from the Seq.
